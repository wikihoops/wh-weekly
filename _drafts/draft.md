To add a new post, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md` and change the  variables `title`, `author` and `spoilers` according to your post. Finally change `published: false` to `published: true`.

You can format your text with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Some basics:

    ## This is large heading

    This is a paragraph with **some bold text**.

    This is another paragraph with a [link](https://google.com).

    ### This is a smaller heading

    > This is a blockquote.
    > 
    > This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
