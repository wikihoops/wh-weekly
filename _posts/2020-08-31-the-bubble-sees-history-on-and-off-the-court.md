Reality bursted in as unprecedented protests from the players resulted in a 3-day break, as they searched for guarantees of political action. In the limited basketball we saw, two high-altitude franchise decided that there aren't any offensive records they aren't willing to break. Let's recall what we went down last week and give a special look towards the series that finished during it.

### Recap: The East Doesn't Linger ; Murray and Mitchell Soar

This week should remembered by the reality that bursted through the NBA bubble. The rest of the league followed the Bucks behind one message: These giant letters on the court can't be some token you slap on the floor to get us to play - political action is necessary. It is not my job to discuss these issues but I would be remiss to pretend nothing happened and I have nothing but empathy and support for the players.

On the sports side, as Tuesday rolled around, only one series of the Eastern Conference first round was left to be decided. With 3 sweeps in 4 series (Boston, Miami and Toronto moving on), only the top team in the conference, the stunned-in-game-1 Milwaukee Bucks, had to endure the drag of a game 5 to send the Orland Magic to their nearby homes.

There have been more 50-point performances in the Nuggets-Jazz series than in any single Playoffs edition ever! The insanity of the shots Mitchell and Murray are daring to try - and somehow making - will be something we will forever remember. The Jazz entered the week up 3-1 but the Nuggets adjusted and have now tied the series as we arrive at a new week, with an improved defense when Michael Porter Jr. was moved to the bench and Jokic making 3 pointers at a high clip, the shots he can get on Gobert. In game 5, Jamal Murray followed a his previous 50 with a 48/8/8 ridiculous performance, 33 of those points in the second half which he entirely played. These two games also saw better rim protection from Denver, as Jokic is now back to hedging the screen with Jeremy Grant and Millsap behind him. In game 6, with the Nuggets collapsing aggressively around the rim, Utah shot 10 out of 21 at the rim in the minutes tracked by CleaningTheGlass. Murray had another 50 point game, 9-12 from deep, and Mitchell finished with 44 points and 9-13 on threes.

The Thunder managed to tie the series at 2 games each against the Rockets on Monday, in an incredible comeback effort. Schröder was a standout with 30 points in 16 shots. In the third quarter, the Thunder’s bench unit delivered a 21-7 run to finish the 3rd tied as Rockets went cold. However, the most interesting adjustment was made by the Rockets: Giving up on the isolation game and running a lot more screens in order for Harden to get rid of Dort, who has been amazing at defending the bearded superstar. The extra space he garnered allowed him to become more efficient and this would become much more evident in the game 5 blowout victory.

Finally, the Lakers ran through the Blazers in 5 games, as the legs gave out on Portland's squad and the Clippers, behind a Kawhi that's looking like the bet player in the league bar none, sent an injury-weakened Dallas team home in 6 games despite Luka Doncic's best efforts.

### Preview: No More Pushovers

The changes in calendar mean we will have a lot more overlap with 1st round and 2nd round matches. So we still have to see the conclusions of the Houston and Thunder series and enjoy what surely will be a must see game 7 between the Jazz and the Nuggets on Tuesday.

We finally have a much anticipated series between Toronto and Boston, the two biggest threats posed to the Bucks control of the East. Boston is the best transition defense in the league and Toronto is very reliant on these moments, being the 2nd team that runs the most transition and top 10 in efficiency. The Raptors need to score well enough to keep up and that should be the biggest swing factor. Both teams are great defenses, the Raptors being #1 in halfcourt defense. But only the Celtics were top 5 on both ends on this season. We will at least see a coaching matchup between two of the most brilliant basketball minds arounds.

7 out of 15 people over at ESPN predicted the Heat to upset the Bucks. Bam is one of the few bigs with enough speed and size to create some problems to the MVP, though we already saw Giannis' spin move annihilating the Heat in the bubble. Defending Giannis in transition, lauding to the ball and shrining the floor, is the priority since over a quarter of his offense is in transition possessions. Moreover, Miami is 2nd in FT Rate offensively while Milwaukee is top 10 in defensive FT Rate - one of these must break. And, with the 3s the Bucks defense allow by design one should note that Miami is tied with Utah in bet 3pt% in the league and, more importantly, they are a clear number 1 in above the break 3s  The Buck might just try to help off Crowder, Iguodala and even Butler to not give the 3 to Herro, Dragic or Robinson. Finally, how do you defend Duncan's handoff game with Bam? Are they bringing Lopez up or do they have Giannis on him? Maybe you can start just trying to fight through the screen to run him off the line. A nice chess match for all the basketball geeks out there.
